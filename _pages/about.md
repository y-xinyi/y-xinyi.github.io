Hi! I'm Xinyi, a graduate student researching Chinese art & archaeology.

About
======
I am a graduate student at the Department of East Asian Languages & Civilizations, University of Pennsylvania. I received my BA with First Class Honors from The University of Hong Kong, where I double majored in art history and music and minored in French. 

You can pronounce my name as: 【shin-yee yeh】

Research Areas
======
My current research interest is the art and archaeology of China and its frontiers. I have broad interests in opera and cultural heritage preservation.

Here are some topics that interest me:
- Buddhist sites in China and Inner Asia
- History of collecting Chinese art
- Folk music/ethnomusicology of East Asia
- Cultural heritage site protection and tourism
- Digital humanities

I am also interested in exploring unconventional/multimedia publication forms for academic research.
